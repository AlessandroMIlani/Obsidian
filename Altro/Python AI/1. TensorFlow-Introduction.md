```python
import tensorflow as tf
```
## Tensors
- generalization of vector, matrix ecc... , to potentially higher dimensions
  - a data point
- every tensor rappresent a partialy definited computation
- hava a data type

## Create a tensor
```python
string = tf.Variable("this is a string", tf.string)  
number = tf.Variable(324, tf.int16)  
floating = tf.Variable(3.567, tf.float64)
```

## Rank/Degree of tensors
- number of dimansion involved in the tensor
- determinated by the deeper level
```python
rank1_tensor = tf.Variable(["test", "ok", "Tim"], tf.string)  # 1 level, 1 list  
rank2_tensor = tf.Variable([["test", "ok"], ["test", "yes"]], tf.string)  # 2 level, a list inside a list
```

## Shape of Tensors
- numbers of elements for eatch level
```python
rank2_tensor.shape  # TensorShape([2,2]) --> 2 list, whit 2 elements
rank1_tensor.shape  # TensorShape([3])  -> 1 list, 3 elements
```
## changing shape
- i can rappresent the same numbers of elements whit differents sahpes
```python
tensor1 = tf.ones([1, 2, 3])  # <-- it's full of 1  
print(tensor1)  
tensor2 = tf.reshape(tensor1, [2, 3, 1])  
tensor3 = tf.reshape(tensor2[3, -1])  # <-- -1 tells the tensor to calculate the size of the dimension in that place
```
## Type of Tensors
- var  --> only mutable during exec.
- Const
- Placeolder
- SpareTensor

## Evaluatiog Tensors
- in other words: get is value
- we need to use a session

```python
with tf.Session() as sess:  # create a session
 tensor1.eval()  # tensor to eval.
```
